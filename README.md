# Smart door: esp8266 implementation

A smart door controller capable of:

1. Taking pictures through the door hole when the door and serve them through a webpage. Still not sure if to do this using a button or each time the door is open.
2. Open the door using a brushless motor (28BYJ-48 stepper motor and UNL-2003 driver.)

Currently work in progress.

# TODO
- [ ] Add circuit diagram
- [ ] Implement the camera component
- [ ] Connect the brushless motor
